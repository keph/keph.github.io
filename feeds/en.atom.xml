was that when my son was born earlier last year, I started... what's the word?
Not microblogging, because I was definitely over twitter's limit. Not,
strictly speaking, blogging, because a) it was still fairly short, and b) it
was piggybacking on Facebook, of all things. Minifaceblogging? Idunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, before you say anything, I made a conscious decision to do whatever I
can to not get sucked into your typical "new parent squees about babby that
was formed". So no marvelling at poop, no overzealous diminutives --
basically, I tried to think about all the shit that would have pissed me off
if I ever saw it on my FB wall, and then not do them. Whether I succeeded is
not really mine to decide, though I hope that I managed to accomplish my goal
at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, about that title,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, partly due to the majority of people on my FB speaking Polish, the
posts were also in Polish. But there's another factor (apart from my incurable
laziness): I couldn't come up with a decent English equivalent of the name I
came up for the title, 'tactwo'. A portmanteau of the word for 'dad', and an
ending '-ctwo' implying "I have no idea what I'm doing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, let's face it, is every new parent's default state. I don't care how
much theory you learned beforehand, how much you THINK you know, when all that
(occasionally literal) shit goes down, you will find yourself not knowing what
even the single solitary fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to GargajCNS of IRC channel #imgurians fame, I think we finally have a
decent equivalent that I feel encompasses all that I tried to convey with the
title: &lt;em&gt;fathergasted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tag you will find posts I originally wrote for FB, except translated
and made into a director's cut version, of sorts. Time and will permitting, of
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've established what this is, one question remains: the blogging
platform I'm currently using lets me ~~do ORWELLIAN RETCONS OF REALITY~~
backdate my posts. So should I set the date of the posts to what it originally
was on FB, or just to whenever I got around to posting them? Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fathergasted"></category><category term="tactwo"></category></entry><entry><title>Let's do this thing.</title><link href="http://keph.github.io/lets-do-this-thing.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Keph</name></author><id>tag:keph.github.io,2015-01-11:lets-do-this-thing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At a loss for a better New Year's resolution, I found myself going with
"do more creative things this year maybe". One of those things being, as you can
see, "start a blog". Start &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; blog, to be exact. A new member in a
prodigious line of blogs I kinda-sorta begun then completely forgot about, if we're being
super-honest here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey, this is the Internet, why would anyone ever lie to you on the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So I guess this is where some introductions are in order.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Keph.
Well not really, it's just a nick I've been using for long enough to pretentiously
claim as my 'online identity'. I would still be bitter about Google+ not having
agreed with that assertion a while back during the whole "nym wars" debacle, if
anyone still gave a fuck about Google+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I tend to be somewhat liberal with my language, particularly all
those bad words your mother probably advised you against using. If this blog were
an animated gif, my advice to you would have been a pair of pixelated black
eyewear slowly descending on someone's eyes, punctuated by "deal with it" in 72pt
black caps-locked Impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speaking of languages,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this is where I take a swan dive into outright braggery and yet
further into pretentiousness: I am fluent in 2 languages, English not even being
my native one (Holy shit can you tell?!). So if this blog ever continues beyond this
post, expect occasional posts in what I presume will be unpronounceable gibberish
to you. Unless you can read Polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a vain attempt at being helpful, I've already put this post in 'en' category
which, if you're not into the whole Poland thing, you might possibly appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if this ever goes anywhere. And since this is both &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; blog attempt
&lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; a New Year resolution, I wouldn't exactly bet money on it.
&lt;em&gt;AND I'M THE AUTHOR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
