</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>At a loss for a better New Year's resolution, I found myself going with
"do more creative things this year maybe". One of those things being, as you can
see, "start a blog". Start <em>another</em> blog, to be exact. A new member in a
prodigious line of blogs I kinda-sorta begun then completely forgot about, if we're being
super-honest here.</p>
<p>And hey, this is the Internet, why would anyone ever lie to you on the Internet?</p>
<h2>So I guess this is where some introductions are in order.</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Keph.
Well not really, it's just a nick I've been using for long enough to pretentiously
claim as my 'online identity'. I would still be bitter about Google+ not having
agreed with that assertion a while back during the whole "nym wars" debacle, if
anyone still gave a fuck about Google+.</p>
<p>As you can see, I tend to be somewhat liberal with my language, particularly all
those bad words your mother probably advised you against using. If this blog were
an animated gif, my advice to you would have been a pair of pixelated black
eyewear slowly descending on someone's eyes, punctuated by "deal with it" in 72pt
black caps-locked Impact.</p>
<h2>Speaking of languages,</h2>
<p>and this is where I take a swan dive into outright braggery and yet
further into pretentiousness: I am fluent in 2 languages, English not even being
my native one (Holy shit can you tell?!). So if this blog ever continues beyond this
post, expect occasional posts in what I presume will be unpronounceable gibberish
to you. Unless you can read Polish.</p>
<p>In a vain attempt at being helpful, I've already put this post in 'en' category
which, if you're not into the whole Poland thing, you might possibly appreciate.</p>
<p>You know, if this ever goes anywhere. And since this is both <em>another</em> blog attempt
<em>AND</em> a New Year resolution, I wouldn't exactly bet money on it.
<em>AND I'M THE AUTHOR.</em></p><p>There are <a href="http://keph.github.io/lets-do-this-thing.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
