</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>One of the factors that drove me to my resolution of writing this here blog
was that when my son was born earlier last year, I started... what's the word?
Not microblogging, because I was definitely over twitter's limit. Not,
strictly speaking, blogging, because a) it was still fairly short, and b) it
was piggybacking on Facebook, of all things. Minifaceblogging? Idunno.</p>
<p>Anyway, before you say anything, I made a conscious decision to do whatever I
can to not get sucked into your typical "new parent squees about babby that
was formed". So no marvelling at poop, no overzealous diminutives --
basically, I tried to think about all the shit that would have pissed me off
if I ever saw it on my FB wall, and then not do them. Whether I succeeded is
not really mine to decide, though I hope that I managed to accomplish my goal
at least to some degree.</p>
<h2>So, about that title,</h2>
<p>Originally, partly due to the majority of people on my FB speaking Polish, the
posts were also in Polish. But there's another factor (apart from my incurable
laziness): I couldn't come up with a decent English equivalent of the name I
came up for the title, 'tactwo'. A portmanteau of the word for 'dad', and an
ending '-ctwo' implying "I have no idea what I'm doing".</p>
<p>Which, let's face it, is every new parent's default state. I don't care how
much theory you learned beforehand, how much you THINK you know, when all that
(occasionally literal) shit goes down, you will find yourself not knowing what
even the single solitary fuck.</p>
<p>Thanks to GargajCNS of IRC channel #imgurians fame, I think we finally have a
decent equivalent that I feel encompasses all that I tried to convey with the
title: <em>fathergasted</em>.</p>
<p>In this tag you will find posts I originally wrote for FB, except translated
and made into a director's cut version, of sorts. Time and will permitting, of
course.</p>
<p>Now that we've established what this is, one question remains: the blogging
platform I'm currently using lets me <s>do ORWELLIAN RETCONS OF REALITY</s>
backdate my posts. So should I set the date of the posts to what it originally
was on FB, or just to whenever I got around to posting them? Hmm.</p><p>There are <a href="http://keph.github.io/fathergasted.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
